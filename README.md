# Comosol_model

What is this repository for?
Comsol-model is a numerical model for CO2 non-isothermal flow process in porous media based on the commercial software COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2.

How do I get set up?
In any machine with COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 installed. Then copy the repository folder (Downloads from the menu on the left of this page). 

Usage
1) For users with COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2: from a terminal launch Comsol-model.
2) After some seconds a dialog window opens. 
3) You can change geothermal temperature distribution and hydrostatic pressure distribution you need in Variables under Component 1.
4ï¼‰In the Model Builder window, under Study 1 click Step 1: Time Independent. After the calculation is completed, click Step 2 under Study 2: Time Dependent.
5) This model ends displaying the counts in the graphic box and creating the output files as needed.
